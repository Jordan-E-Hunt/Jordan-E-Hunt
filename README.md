###About Me

Welcome! As a software engineer, I love navigating consumer needs while creating robust, accessible applications to solve problems. I enjoy exploring the depths of End-to-End Machine Learning from data pipelining to deployment, and I am always open to using new tools and conquering new frameworks.

Currently, I am serving as **Teacher Assistant for Programming II**, where I help students master the fundamentals of memory management and Object-Oriented Programming.

### Core Competencies
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Memory:** Strong foundation in C++ and Python. Experienced in teaching and implementing memory allocation, and efficient architectural patterns.
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Deep conceptual understanding of agent-environment loops, specifically utilizing **Stable Baselines3** and **DQN** architectures to solve sequential decision-making problems.
* **Data Systems:** Proficient in **SQL** and Database Management, bridging the gap between raw data storage and AI-ready pipelines.
* **Algorithmic Theory:** Academic background in the Theory of Computation and Algorithm Design, focused on writing performant, optimized code.
